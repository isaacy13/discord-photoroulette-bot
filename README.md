# What is Photo Roulette?
Photo roulette is a party game *perfect for discord* where players put a pool of pictures into a "**hat**". The computer then **randomly** chooses a picture out of the "**hat**" and everyone guesses whose picture it is!

## Getting Started:
### How do I get the bot onto my server?
To get started, you have to have:
**1. A discord account
2. A discord server where you have the permissions to "Manage" the server**

Then, you click the following link:
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=760273969688739882&scope=bot&permissions=52224

**Login to discord** (if you haven't already)
**Select the server you want to add the bot to** from the "add to server" dropdown menu
**Select continue** and the bot should load onto your server!

### But I want to run the bot locally
No problem! Just download the bot and follow the instructions under "*How do I get the bot onto my server?*". After that, **run the bot.py file** in a program of your choice!

### Okay, the bot is on my server, so how do I get it going?
So the bot is loaded onto the server, but it doesn't know which text-channel you want it to be in. To tell it where to go, go into a text-channel of your choice, and type in **!setup**
This will let the bot know which text-channel to go to. If all goes well, it should reply with a successful message! If you want to move it to another text-channel, go into another text-channel and type **!setup** there.

### What's the point of this bot?
### Why did you make this?
As part of the Aggie Coding Club, I was invited to participate in the *Capsher Coding Challenge*! Creating a discord bot seemed interesting and so I decided to dip my toes into it. Although I was alotted about a month's worth of time, I was only able to work on it for about 12 hours due to studying and exams. However, this was a really cool experience because I got to see the "fruits of my labor" at the end of it.
